    <h4>Out of what I can offer to fellow tech students that they might not already know, is my knowledge of skincare.</h4>
        <br> 
    <p>I've been researching it for quite a while now and have gained some know-how on what works for what skin types and what products are good, 
        <br>so I might be able to recommend some to anyone who is interested in trying out skincare, whther for skin concerns or just because it feels nice!</p>
